Hello, my name is Christina Leung.  I am a data science researcher.  I use machine learning and deep learning models in predictive analytics.  My research areas include mining time series transaction data, data preparation, imbalance dataset and data augmentation etc.
[View my publication](https://aisel.aisnet.org/amcis2020/data_science_analytics_for_decision_support/data_science_analytics_for_decision_support/28/)

The following are some of my projects:
1. Python
   Churn Prediction Analytics: I use customer transaction data in a US bank to develop a churn prediction model, to enable the customer             retention team to identify potential churners early and to take preemptive actions.
