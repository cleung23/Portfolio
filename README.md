Hello, my name is Christina Leung.  I am a data science researcher.  I use machine learning and deep learning models in predictive analytics.  My research areas include mining time series transaction data and imbalance dataset etc.
[View my publication](https://aisel.aisnet.org/amcis2020/data_science_analytics_for_decision_support/data_science_analytics_for_decision_support/28/)

The following are some of my projects:
## 1. Python
   Churn Prediction Analytics: I use customer transaction data in a US bank to develop a churn prediction model.  This model can enable customer retention team to identify potential churners early and to take preemptive actions.

### a. [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/cleung23/Python-Code/blob/bb4614cfd589fb43f0fe634254fe5abd2a8d8f52/Customer%20Segmentation.ipynb)

### b. [Sampling Methods](https://github.com/cleung23/Python-Code/blob/bb4614cfd589fb43f0fe634254fe5abd2a8d8f52/Sampling%20Methods.ipynb)

### c. [Split Samples](https://github.com/cleung23/Python-Code/blob/bb4614cfd589fb43f0fe634254fe5abd2a8d8f52/Split%20Sample.ipynb)

### d. [Building Time Series](https://github.com/cleung23/Python-Code/blob/3bef045602b1a64cb99ade62ade53e2581c1763c/Building%20TS.ipynb)

### e. [Machine Learning](https://github.com/cleung23/Python-Code/blob/01c4413a61cf3bb1eeda9d5c2ce6881750f61171/ML.ipynb)

### f. [Deep Learning](https://github.com/cleung23/Python-Code/blob/42575cfcb2cf34f0b152b028863186ee9ba8e77f/Deep%20Learning.ipynb)

   
## 2. R
   Credit Approval Model: I use customer records to predict consumer loan approval.
   Skills involved: Data preparation, machine learning, cross validation, hyperparameter tuning etc.
